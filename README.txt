This game is in a Game-Jam theme that Meta.AI suggested to me.
"Symmetry": Design a game where symmetry plays a crucial role in gameplay or visuals.

Meta.AI created an idea and started writing the code for me.
I asked: "Create a game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed for mobile (no keyboard needed), and for portrait mode. Design a game where symmetry plays a crucial role in gameplay or visuals. The game can be any genre or theme, but symmetry should be very important to the player winning. If possible, use Object-Oriented programming, and let me know folder structure. Thanks!"

Meta.AI generated HTML, CSS, and JS code, and I noticed it used keyboard controls, so I asked it for some modifications.
Meta.AI also gave this game description:
Here's a simple game that incorporates symmetry as a crucial element. The game is called "Symmetry Match" and it's a puzzle game where players must rotate and mirror tiles to create symmetrical patterns.
Game Description:
The game consists of a 4x4 grid, divided into two halves. The player's goal is to create symmetrical patterns by rotating and mirroring tiles on the left half of the grid to match the right half.

How to Play:
1. Open index.html in a mobile browser or emulator.
2. Tap on a tile on the left half of the grid to rotate it.
3. Tap on a tile on the right half of the grid to mirror it.
4. Try to create symmetrical patterns by rotating and mirroring tiles.
5. Each time you create a symmetrical pattern, your score will increase and the tiles will reset.
Features:
1. Symmetry-based gameplay
2. Rotation and mirroring of tiles
3. Randomly generated tile patterns
4. Score tracking
5. Touch-friendly interface
Future Improvements:
1. Add levels with increasing difficulty
2. Implement different tile patterns and shapes
3. Add sound effects and music
4. Improve graphics and animations
5. Add leaderboards and social sharing features
